# Open Problems

## Finding Origin of Replication
Please find them at [Bioinformatics Algorithm course on Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/bioinformatics-001/lecture/49)
* We want to develop a computational test that may help us to figure out whether this or any other bacterial genome actually uses 2 replication origins.
* We want to find the origins of replication in archaea.
* There are still no algorithms or software tools for predicting origins of replication in yeast, and Uri Keich will direct your research project aimed at solving this problem.

## Protein sequence
Beltway and Turnpike Problems (No polynomial algorithms yet):
* Beltway Problem: *Given the pairwise distances, how to reconstruct the points in the circle*
* Turnpike Problem: *Given the pairwise distances, how to reconstruct the points on a line segment instead of a circle* (Turnpike Problem has a pseudo-polynomial algorithm, which is polynomial in the length of the *segment*.)

Sequencing Cyclic Peptides in Primates
> Current paradigm: humans don't produce cyclic peptides. But maybe, like antibiotics, they've been there all along, waiting to be discovered ...
> Question: Do humans produce Cyclic Peptides?
