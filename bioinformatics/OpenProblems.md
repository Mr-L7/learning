## Finding Origin of Replication
Please find them at [Bioinformatics Algorithm course on Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/bioinformatics-001/lecture/49)
* We want to develop a computational test that may help us to figure out whether this or any other bacterial genome actually uses 2 replication origins.
* We want to find the origins of replication in archaea.
* There are still no algorithms or software tools for predicting origins of replication in yeast, and Uri Keich will direct your research project aimed at solving this problem.
