# Hidden Message in the Replication Origin

Indeed, we know that the initiation of replication is mediated by *DnaA*, a protein that binds to a short segment within the oriC known as a *DnaA box*.

For the direction of DNA strand, please refer to [Detour Chemical Basis for Directonality of DNA Strands](https://stepic.org/Bioinformatics-Algorithms-2/Detour-Chemical-Basis-for-Directionality-of-DNA-Strands-14/step/1)

> DNA polymerase copies the template strand in the 3’ → 5’ direction. Note that it creates the daughter strand in the 5’ → 3’ direction.
