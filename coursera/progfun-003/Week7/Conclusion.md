# Course Conclusion

## Traits of Functional Programming
Functional programming provides a coherent set of notations and methods based on 
* higher-order functions,
* case classes and pattern matching,
* immutable collections,
* absence of mutable state,
* flexible evaluation strategies: *strict*/*lazy*/*by name*.

## What Remains to Be Covered
Functional programming and state
* what does it mean to have mutable state?
* what changes if we add it?

Parallelism
* how to exploit immutability for parallel execution.

Domain-Specific Languages
* high-level libraries as embedded DSLs.
* interpretation techniques for external DSLs.
